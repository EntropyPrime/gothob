<h1>Memetic Graphs</h1>

<p>
    Due to the rapid rate at which humans <a href="./realityhacking.html">began mentally modifying ξ,</a> certain sets resembling human
    thought patterns started dominating <a href="universe.html">the universe's</a> pool of available possibilities, and our universe 
    began statistically skewing more towards human thought. The propagation of some forms of information over others, and some ideas 
    over others, has contributed to this, further forcing our direction into the human conceptualized reality. A reality hacker's goal
    is to redefine the pool of available realities and the pathways to achieve them so that the universe is not following a path of 
    minimal deviation thought. However, the influence one person's contributions on <a href="Xi.html">ξ</a> can have is limited, and restricted by many factors
    and to many variables.
</p>

<p>
    For this reason, it is important that a <a href="./realityhacking.html">reality hacker</a> understand the significance of the memetic graphs of ideas, and who has
    thought about them and contributed to ξ. A group of reality hackers can develop their ideas together to create more powerful 
    influences upon ξ as the connections in ξ to the desired outcome increase. These memetic networks are essential for creating 
    changes that can self maintain themselves instead of being destroyed within the chaotic changing nature of ξ.
