<h2>Language and ξ</h2>

<p>
    The recursive property of <a href="Xi.html">ξ</a> is necessary for the representation of symbols in ξ, since every symbol in ξ has a connection to ξ.
    It would not be unreasonable, therefor, to say that any connections between two ideas in ξ use this property. Indeed, for two symbols
    in ξ to connect, they must in some capacity route through ξ, and so the very idea of two things interacting contributes to ξ.
</p>

<p>
    One natural conclusion of this idea is that any form of presenting or representing information makes use of this property. Indeed,
    humans have been wielding it since before even our modern evolution with the use of language. Any communication, as it contains an
    idea, introduces a symbol into ξ. Language, like <a href="realityhacking.html">math,</a> represents a robust set of rules for generating 
    these symbols and connecting them to the consciousness of other lifeforms. 
</p>

<p>
    In that sense, ξ can be understood as much as a language as it is a math. For every symbol, ξ effectively offers an
    alphabet with which the universe can manifest them. This perspective allows for thinking about ξ in a range of ways, from 
    a complex, nonlinear written story of the universe, to the source code of everything.
</p>

<p>
    So is ξ recursive naturally? Or was language a backdoor into its contents so that humans could begin one of the largest scale 
    hacks in the history of <a href="universe.html">The Universe?</a> Although the human use of language to streamline manipulating ξ
    in order to share and develop ideas has had profound impact on the shape of reality, the presence of the ability of communication 
    elsewhere suggests an origin to the recursion from far earlier. Perhaps ξ first had to form the connections necessary to create
    complex new symbols within itself.
