<h1>ξ</h1>
<p>
    ξ (Xi) is one of the most essential ideas presented in this theory. It describes a universal set of representations of things in reality.
    That is to say, everything within ξ is not necessarily a concrete object, but a formula for something which one or multiple of can exist.
    This means that ξ effectively encompasses the set of things that "can be real," and can be said to represent the set of reality. 
    It could also be represented as a graph showing the correlations between every concept in reality, though such a graph would be infinitely large.

<p>
    ξ also contains itself. This comes with a consequence that is of particular interest for <a href="./realityhacking.html">Reality Hackers;</a> representations of the 
    contents of ξ created within ξ are also contained within ξ. That is to say, if you can represent something that could be in ξ,
    it becomes a part of ξ and becomes able to be manifested within the <a href="./universe.html">universe.</a> this inevitably means that some operations within 
    ξ result in paradoxical self reference, a dangerous set of edge cases that when created could threaten the stability of the contents
    of ξ.
