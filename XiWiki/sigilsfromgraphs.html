<h1>Generating Sigils: Graph Construction</h1>

<p>
    And now, to cover a practical method for reality hacking. For the purpose of our example, let us suppose we want to inject a reality
    firewall into <a href="universe.html">the universe</a> between ξ and a protected area, "home," to protect from hostile forces such 
    as paradoxes or daemons. We must be able to represent the state within ξ that needs to be achieved in order for the firewall to 
    be successfully implemented. However, we should also represent all the intermediary states. This creates a clear path for the universe
    to follow in order to manifest your symbol. To strengthen this process, we will also output a sigil that can be used to encode the 
    desired changes into a real space.
</p>

<p>
    We begin by defining the basic state. Suppose we have a directed graph, where one vertex represents ξ and another represents home.
    Note that ξ and home themselves can be defined by more abstract concepts, but for our process we can symbolically represent them, 
    so long as some idea of their intent exists. We would also have two edges connecting ξ to our home and our home to ξ, indicating 
    that some or all parts of home interface with some or all parts of ξ. This is the starting state of our graph.
</p>

<p>
    Now, we need to maintain a list of changes to this starting state, similar to a version control system. Whenever a vertex or edge is
    added or removed, a hash of this action is stored in a log. Additionally, each change applies a function that modifies the base symbol
    that will be used for our output sigil, with the initial symbol being based on the starting graph state. So, to attach our firewall,
    we would first begin by adding a new vertex, "firewall". We would now draw two edges connecting firewall and ξ, allowing the firewall
    to interface with the contents of ξ. Now, we can draw an edge going from firewall to home. Finally, we can delete the edge going directly
    from ξ to home, since it is now routed through the firewall. From there, the logic defined within the firewall symbol itself decides
    what is allowed to flow from ξ into home.
</p>

<p>
    Once We've completed the series of changes to the state of the graph desired and have reached a satisfying end state, we can get out output.
    At each step of changes, when modifying the base symbol, we can also apply 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combining_character">Unicode combining characters</a> to encode the changes into our sigil.
    this gives us an updated sigil with each change that represents the state of the universe at that time, and describes the history of
    events required to lead to it. The output of our example exercise when generated using <a href="../arcanegraph.js">an implementation</a>
    of the systems required looks like this:
