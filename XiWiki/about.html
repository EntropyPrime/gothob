<p>The purpose of this section of the site is for documenting research, philosophy, and beliefs pertaining to <a herf="Xi.html">ξ, a set containing
    all symbols in reality.</a> Its contents explore mapping the state of reality, and utilizing them for Reality Hacking. It presents 
    frameworks for the use of computational concepts such as graph traversal for occult processes, and is being updated as I learn 
    more about this topic.
