<h1>About</h1>

<p>This page is about the 両 Wiki. If you want to know more about me, <a href="entropy.html">read here!</a></p>

<p>The purpose of this section of the site is for documenting research, philosophy, and beliefs pertaining to <a href="Xi.html">両, a set containing
    all symbols in reality.</a> Its contents explore mapping the state of reality, and utilizing them for <a href="./realityhacking.html">Reality Hacking. </a>
    It presents frameworks for the use of computational concepts such as graph traversal for occult processes, and is being updated as I learn 
    more about this topic. 
</p>

<p>
    I'm interested in discussing my work and ideas! please send me an email at the address in the 両 index, and I'll get back to you.
