<h2>The Death of Madness</h2>
<h3>And: The New Alienation of Reason</h3>

<p>When I was a child, I understood the world as a strictly rational place. Existence was defined by a series of observations and 
    rules within those, and many of those rules had been defined long ago by people I would never even think to ask the names of 
    for most of my life, but the reasoning they were built on was foundational, unwaivering. If there was any conflict, then the 
    thing violating the most basic rules must be invalid. It was for this reason I didn't believe in magic, I didn't believe in Santa or the Easter Bunny,
    and, despite my strict unquestioning Christian upbringing, I felt my prayers falling as meaningless words upon empty air.
</p>

<p>
    Then, when I was 22, I experienced my first arcane vision, my mathematical studies suddenly culminating into a dramatic, 
    violent awareness of the structure of reality, of the threads connecting ideas and the information projected into physicality 
    around me. A world suddenly came into existence where invisible lines formed meaning and impossibilities collapsed under the 
    syntax of the rules constraining them. Speaking to many others, this seems like it presents a distressing turning point to them- 
    but for me, it was the result of something I had anticipated for years; I was observing my own slide into madness.
</p>

<p>
    To expect the irrational is unatural for humans. We are constantly adjusting our understandings of the world, and with it, 
    the bounds of the things that can happen. But we carry expectations of what can not happen, and through our communications, 
    we collectively expanded our understanding of what can and can not be to a degree of far extremes that we reach today. Someone 
    who behaves against this line of observational reasoning and larger knowledge acts against the truth we have devised of our 
    world; they are insane. And yet, so insatiable has been our push to understand every observation, that fields of knowledge 
    emerged to analyze the rules of humans themselves. To expect the irrational is unnatural for humans, and yet, piece by piece, 
    we started finding for it names, and faces, and suddenly a candidate for insanity was formed.
</p>

<p>
    Where mystery in myth and wonder was dead to me in my youth, I found another source; the mind. I poured over writings on topics 
    like hypnosis and thoughtforms (a hobby I never quite stopped), fascinated by the potential for this mechanism to break its own 
    rules. But in due time the clinical roots that had poisoned this study would have its influence made obvious. For the world, 
    this domain was no longer one of mystery, but the last corner to isolate impossibility within. Trance, prayer, visions, ghosts, 
    angels, hypercubes, hallucinations, phobias and insanity, all contained in skulls that could readily break the rules around them 
    inconsequentially.
</p>

<p>
    What does it mean to experience the impossible? This experience, despite the implications it would carry, has always been 
    a part of the human experience as we continued to redefine our understanding of what can be. And where impossibilities emerged 
    that we could not find a clear explanation for, new curiosities arose. But what does it mean to experience the impossible when 
    it has been weeded out of the world, and confined within? What does it mean to have that experience as the child who believes in 
    nothing that can't be seen because the world around them has been solved for some time? In a world so defined by reason and rules, 
    it is almost most effectively to simply throw out such experiences as an artifact of ourselves, which we know can be irrational. 
    Indeed, years after receiving my visions, they remain very important to my understanding of the world, how I carry myself today,
    my beliefs. But despite that, I know I must exist in a world where I have to balance understanding what I have glimpsed as important, 
    while understanding it as impossible, just a consequence of an irrational brain generating meaningless signals. 
    But what about when the impossible impedes, creates pressure, attacks us with its paradox? 
</p>

<p>
    For those who suffer, those schools that seek to identify candidates of madness toil away to further reduce the mental mystery, 
    to crack the code of all of its remaining shapes and figure out how to allievate the stimuli it generates. For many, their works 
    have yielded successes, easing that pain which we can not see and can only hope to understand. For others though, they have 
    left a landscape that demands answers, but can not truly glimpse into their worlds. When the faces of madness are known, then 
    it should be clear that we can identify those, treat the pain, resolve the paradoxes. And yet we have left a world full of insane  
    people that our names of madness can not identify or aid, left with their own personal mysteries. 
    For such an existence, there are two logical conclusions- either a person is not mad and suffers in an unidentifiable but 
    typical, rational fashion, or they have experienced an impossibility outside the catalog human knowledge, one that they 
    cannot possibly be aided within.
</p>

<p>
    In this way, the rational world not only robs us of mystery, but divorces us so far from the irrational that it can not be 
    rectified. In a world where insanity exists, is known and identified and can be compared to, then awe and anguish all the same 
    can be written off as something else. Something to not give a second look, something to neither embrace nor challenge. And 
    when one can only be left uncertain as to if their experiences have fallen within one of these categories or another, can not 
    determine if they themselves have become insane within this framework, then the death of madness within ourselves has done its 
    course, and we have become afflicted with a doubt of if our inner existences contain any potential for irregularity at all, 
    and we are robbed of ourselves right down to the right to be seen suffering.
